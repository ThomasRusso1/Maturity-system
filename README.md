# Comments
This is the first revision of this project. Further modifications will be made, and additional documentation will be added. The first prototype using a Raspberry Pi as computing device allows to have a graphical user interface on a monitor, save data to an online database, and access data / control the setup from a webpage. The system is made to be adapted to any specific need, therefore, a minimum coding experience is required. The first prototype can also be used headlessly, meaning without being connected to a monitor. The code is different than the one meant to be used with a monitor, since the integration of controls via push buttons, and a graphical user interface on LCD screen was developed. 
A second prototype is under development, using an arduino board as computing device. Complete documentation will be uploaded in a near future.
